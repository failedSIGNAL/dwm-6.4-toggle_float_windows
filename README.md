This patch modified Rule struct, adding position x, y and dimension w, h.


x,y,w,h will be measure in percentage of current monitor.
It also added a toggle-ability for each class of window.

This was inspired by scratchpad, but eventually I want to add more and more
applications that can be toggled.
